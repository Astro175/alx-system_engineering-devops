Server: This is required to host one or more of the components of the web application.
For example, it could host the web server, application server, or database server.

Load-balancer (HAproxy): This is necessary to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers hosting the web application components.
This ensures that no single server gets overloaded with traffic and helps to maintain high availability.

Split components: Separating the web server, application server, and database server onto their own individual servers allows
for more efficient resource management, easier scaling, and better fault tolerance. It also helps to isolate potential security
breaches and reduces the impact of a single component failure on the entire web application.

Overall, adding these elements improves the performance, scalability, and availability of the web application while also providing
better security and fault tolerance.
